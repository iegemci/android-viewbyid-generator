android-viewbyid-generator
==========================

[Android Annotations](https://androidannotations.org) `@ViewById` annotation generator for Android Studio / IntelliJ IDEA, heavily based on the [ButterKnifeZelezny](https://github.com/inmite-android-butterknife-zelezny) plugin.

How to install
--------------
I am currently waiting to have this approved in the JetBrains Plugin Repository.

Usage
-----
1. Select your `R.layout.layout_name` name in your @EActivity, @EFragment or @EViewGroup and right click it.
2. Select `Generate / Generate @ViewById entries` or press cmd+ctrl+option+v.
3. Select the annotations you want to use, change their names, whatever you want.
4. Confirm - and it is done :)
